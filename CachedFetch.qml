// One network resource, cached on disk, with offline fallback.
//
// Every fetch in the plugin goes through this component, so caching, staleness,
// retry, and TTL behave identically for the calendar, the standings, the
// results, and the circuit metadata rather than being reinvented per call site.
//
// The whole read-through cache is one small shell pipeline, which keeps the
// atomic write (download to a private mktemp file, rename into place) and the
// "serve what we have when the network is down" fallback in a single step:
//
//   CACHE  the file on disk is younger than ttlSeconds — no request was made
//   FRESH  the network answered and the cache was replaced
//   STALE  the request failed; the previous cached copy is being served
//   MISS   the request failed and there is nothing cached to fall back on
//
// A STALE result still emits its payload. That is the point: a flaky network
// or a rate-limited API degrades the panel to "last known good, labelled as
// such" instead of to an empty box.
